Get up and running with FORGE in under 5 minutes.

## Installation

### Global Installation (Recommended)

```bash
# Install FORGE globally with auto-configured Claude Code subagents
npm install -g forge-framework

# Verify installation
forge --version  # Should output: 2.0.0
```

### What Gets Installed

The global installation automatically:
- Installs the `forge` CLI command globally
- Configures 6 specialized Claude Code subagents
- Sets up the FORGE framework for immediate use
- No additional configuration required

This installs FORGE globally and automatically configures 6 specialized Claude Code subagents:
- **forge-architect** - System architecture design and planning
- **forge-developer** - Code implementation and feature development  
- **forge-tester** - Testing strategies and quality assurance
- **forge-devops** - Infrastructure and deployment automation
- **forge-reviewer** - Code review and quality assessment
- **forge-analyzer** - Codebase analysis and insights

## Initialize Your Project

```bash
cd your-project
forge init
```

This creates a minimal `forge.yaml` configuration. Ask your AI assistant (Claude, etc.) to analyze your project and update the configuration.

## Start Building

```bash
forge new "user authentication"
```

This starts a new development cycle. FORGE implements Intent-Driven Development through 5 validated phases:
1. **Focus** 🎯 - Clarity: What & Why (problem statement, success criteria, C4 L1)
2. **Orchestrate** 📋 - Planning: Break It Down (C4 L2-L3, dependency map, session-sized tasks)
3. **Refine** ✏️ - Precision: Define "Done" (acceptance criteria, interfaces, edge cases - NO CODE)
4. **Generate** ⚡ - Creation: TDD Code (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
5. **Evaluate** ✅ - Verification (criteria check, security review, disposition)

### Phase Validation (v2.0.0+)

FORGE enforces proper progression through validated phases:

```bash
forge status              # Visual progress bars showing phase completion
forge phase               # Show current phase details
forge phase next          # Move to next phase (validates requirements)
forge complete            # Complete cycle (only when all phases done)
forge complete --force    # Force completion (use sparingly)
```

**Important**: You cannot skip phases or complete prematurely. Each phase has mandatory requirements (e.g., test scenarios in Focus phase).

## Core Commands

- `forge init` - Initialize FORGE in your project
- `forge new <feature>` - Start a new development cycle
- `forge status` - Check current progress
- `forge complete` - Archive completed cycle
- `forge document` - Manage documentation
- `forge learn` - View and update learnings

### Claude Code Slash Commands

When using Claude Code, you can also use explicit slash commands:
- `/forge init` - Initialize FORGE
- `/forge new authentication` - Start new cycle
- `/forge status` - Check progress
- `/forge complete` - Complete cycle
- `/forge help` - Get help

Both work equally well - use whichever feels natural!

## Working with AI

FORGE is designed for AI-driven development. After each command, engage with your AI assistant:

```
You: forge new "shopping cart"
You: Let's design a shopping cart feature

Claude: I'll use the forge-architect subagent to design this system...

[forge-architect activated]
As your architecture specialist, I'll design the shopping cart system:
1. First, let me analyze your current codebase...
2. I'll create test scenarios before designing...
3. Now designing the cart architecture...
```

## Key Concepts

### Claude Code Subagents
FORGE automatically configures Claude Code subagents that operate in isolated contexts:
- **forge-architect** - System design and planning (Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Task, TodoWrite)
- **forge-developer** - Code implementation (Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Bash, Glob, Grep, Task, TodoWrite)
- **forge-tester** - Quality assurance (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep, Task, TodoWrite)
- **forge-devops** - Infrastructure and deployment (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep, Task, TodoWrite)
- **forge-reviewer** - Code and design review (Read, Grep, Glob, Edit, Task, TodoWrite)
- **forge-analyzer** - Codebase analysis and insights (Read, Glob, Grep, Task, TodoWrite)

Each subagent has specialized expertise and operates in its own context to prevent confusion.

### Test-First Development
All agents enforce TDD. You must define test scenarios before writing code.

### Documentation
- PRDs go in `specs/`
- All other docs go in `docs/`
- Use `forge document` for AI-powered documentation management
